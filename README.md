## Prerequisites
We're going to need the following installed on your machine.

### NPM/Yarn
Either one of these can be installed. I personally use Yarn - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

### Node 
I'd suggest installing NVM - https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows, this will allow you to install mutliple versions of node on your machine and switch between them. We can chat through why this is a thing.

### Git
You'll need to have git installed on your machine. 

### Terminal
You can use the default windows one if you want, but there's other alternatives out there which are better. CMDER seems to be a popular windows one which has some nice features baked in - https://cmder.net/
